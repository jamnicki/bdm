# Basics of decision making course project

The goal of our project was to determine on what days of the year to send
available weather balloons to maximize the chance of collecting a sample.
We had n weather balloons available, with a limit of one
balloon per day. We had data showing the probability of
of a balloon collecting a sample depending on weather conditions for each
day during the year. To solve our maximization problem
we used solver and genetic, simulated annealing, tabu search algorithms.
We visualized the results of the algorithms as a calendar using the *tkinter* library like below
